# Conclusion

Hi!

Thanks for allowing me to show you my frontend web development skills - I had a lot of fun with this small challenge!

## Tools

I decided to use React for this project as I am quite tight on time, and though I have worked in Vue before I am not as comfortable or up to date with the best practices. Though if I had a weekend to complete it in I would have loved to get my hands dirty and up to date with Vue.

## Things I like

I always enjoy building with Next.js as it is quick to get running and build an application.

It was my first time using CSS modules and I did enjoy using them, however I see many disadvantages and see it a not very complete solution to scoping CSS. I am more used to working with Styled Components, or with Svelte (and Vue) where you have a block to declare a components styles.

I also enjoyed adding animations as at my current job these are always an afterthought - a rainbow in the distance of "when we have enough time".

I am happy that I have tested all of my utils - even though the tests are fairly basic.

## Things I did not like

I would have like to spend more time bolstering the theme, I dove in too quickly by building the screens and should have spent more time at the start analyzing the images and creating a theme. I am more used to working with a design program like Figma and found it quite unusual to design from jpg's. This is one of the reasons why the design and outcome are not perfectly matching - I could of course have got it exact - but I used my "poetic license" and went my own way (e.g not using the green button because why are their 3 button styles on 3 pages?)

I would of course would have like to write it in Vue, add more and better tests, UI tests, but this is more of a time constraint then anything else.

I am not sure about my way of storing the results of the shoe quiz in the url - my initial thought would be that it would be good for deep-link a certain shoe to a client - or to save this list easily on their profile. That I suppose is more of a UX decision.

I also wondered about saving the form steps to the url - so you don't always have to start the form from scratch.

## Conclusion of the conclusion

Overall I had a lot of fun building this - it is nice to take time away from my usual projects to build something fresh.

I look forward to hearing from you!
